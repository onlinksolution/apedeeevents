                  <p className="font-storyFont">At Ape Dee Events, our journey began with a passion for music and a deep commitment to making a difference. Founded with the vision of promoting Sri Lankan artists on the global stage, we organize music events that showcase the rich cultural heritage and talent of Sri Lanka. <br />

                    But our mission goes beyond just music. We believe in giving back to the community that inspires us. That's why every event we host is not just a celebration of artistry, but also a means to support a greater cause. The revenue generated from our events is dedicated to funding scholarships for needy children in Sri Lanka, helping them achieve their dreams through education. <br />

                    By choosing Ape Dee Events, you're not only enjoying world-class entertainment, but you're also contributing to a brighter future for the next generation. Together, we're turning music into a force for good.</p>
